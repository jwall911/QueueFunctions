# QueueFunctions
This program prompts the user for a choice, based on the choice the program will create a queue, enqueue, dequeue, print &amp; boolean checks.


This program includes a queueMain.cpp file to hold main & process user options, queueFun.cpp file for queue function implementation, and a queueFun.h file for the function stubs. 
The main program displays a menu to the user requesting input, uses the functions provided by the extra files. 
(create queue, enqueue, dequeue, check if queue is created/empty/full & print)

I know that including a cpp isn't good practice. I did this for experimenting.
